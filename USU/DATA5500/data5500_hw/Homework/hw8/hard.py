# Write a Python function that takes a NetworkX graph as input and returns the number of nodes in the graph that have a degree greater than 5

# importing libraries

# importing libraries to plot the graph

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# finding the current directory

# ChatGPT

# Pompt:
# "what is the syntax for using degree()"

# Output:
# The syntax for using the degree() method in NetworkX depends on whether you want to get the degree of all nodes or just a specific node:

# 1. Get the Degree of All Nodes
# G.degree() returns a view of the degree of each node in the graph.
# You can loop through it or convert it to a list or dictionary to see each nodeâ€™s degree.

# for node, degree in G.degree():
#    print(f"Node {node} has a degree of {degree}")

# 2. Get the Degree of a Specific Node
# If you want the degree of a single node, pass the node as an argument to G.degree(node).

# print(G.degree(1))  # Outputs the degree of node 1

# 3. Get Degree as a Dictionary
# To store degrees as a dictionary for easy access, you can use a dictionary comprehension.

# degree_dict = dict(G.degree())
# print(degree_dict)

# 4. Weighted Degree (Optional)
# If your graph has weighted edges, you can pass weight="weight" to get the weighted degree, where edge weights are summed.

# weighted_degrees = G.degree(weight="weight")
# for node, degree in weighted_degrees:
#    print(f"Node {node} has a weighted degree of {degree}")

# These options let you get node degrees in different formats depending on your needs. Let me know if you have any other questions!
